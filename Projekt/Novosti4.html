			<h2>Arsenal 2-0 Chelsea: How it happened</h2>
			<p class="description">Goals from Alex Lacazette and Laurent Koscielny sealed a fine victory at Emirates Stadium that puts us within touching distance of Chelsea in the race for a top-four place.</p>
			<p>We flew out of the traps, snapping into tackles and pulling the visitors around as we looked to take advantage of any early vulnerabilities.</p>
			<p>But less than 60 seconds later, our dominance was rewarded as Hector Bellerin found Lacazette in the area, whose sublime first touch set him up, before he took the ball away from the defender and squeezed his drive into the top corner.</p>
			<p>Aubameyang was inches away from doubling our advantage with a stunning overhead kick, but Koscielny made no mistake moments later as he rose highest to meet Sokratis ball into the box, diverting the ball into the net via his shoulder.</p>
			<p>But we continued to threaten ourselves on the break, with Sead Kolasinac and Hector Bellerin creating havoc from the full-back positions. But the latter would soon depart on a stretcher in obvious discomfort after sustaining a worrying looking injury – fingers crossed it is not as serious as it appeared to be.</p>
			<p>The Blues continued to pile on the pressure, but we stood firm – with Sokratis and Koscielny positively relishing the battle – and finally, after a lengthy spell of added time, we had the win.</p>
